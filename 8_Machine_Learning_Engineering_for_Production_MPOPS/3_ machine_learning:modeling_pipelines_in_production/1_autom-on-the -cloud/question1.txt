Which of the following characteristics best describe hyperparameters? (Select all that apply)
1 / 1 分

Hyperparameters are derived via training.

Hyperparameters are set before launching the learning process.
正确

Excellent! They need to be set before model training begins.

Hyperparameters are not optimized in each training step.
正确

You’re right on track! Hyperparameters are not automatically optimized during the training process.

Hyperparameters can be quite numerous even in small models.
正确

Great job! Hyperparameters can be numerous, so, performing manual hyperparameter tuning can be a real brain teaser.
